## Highlights
- [[Taoism]] isn’t about doing nothing and letting things happen to you. It’s about taking action that makes sense in the context of your life.
- Life isn’t about the final destination. It’s about the journey.
- Find the good in it when it’s gone. Be grateful it existed in the first place.
- [[Buddhism]] says that we shouldn’t attach so much importance to impermanent things.
- [[Taoism]] says we can and should attach meaning and importance to them. We should enjoy them. It’s what makes life worth living. We just shouldn’t mourn (too much) the loss of something we knew we’d lose from the start.
- The now is what matters.

- This impermanence is what gives life meaning and should also give us urgency in going out and experiencing all that there is to experience.
- If we live as if there is infinite time with all these impermanent things, then that’s how we experience real loss and regret.
