- Even though we’re all human beings,” said rich dad, “when it comes to money and the emotions attached to money, we all respond differently. And it’s how we respond to those emotions that often determines which quadrant we choose to generate our income from.” Robert Kiyosaki
  Rich dad continued his lesson, “If you want to be successful on the right side, when it comes to money, you must know the difference between facts and opinions. You cannot blindly accept financial advice the way people on the left side do. You must know your numbers. You must know the facts. And numbers tell you the facts.” Robert Kiyosaki

It’s first how you think that needs to change.” Robert Kiyosaki ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1510745096/19736229))
