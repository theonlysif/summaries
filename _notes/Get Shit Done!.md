- Every time you say Yes to distractions, even for a moment, this builds up. It becomes a tendency in your mind, a habit, if you please, and the next time you get a new message your monkey mind will force you to stop what you’re doing and “check that new email”.

- The task is always to write, the goal is to write on a predetermined topic. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1510745078/19736262))

- Make sure you have everything you need before you start working: For instance, before I start writing I make a coffee and I fill my water pitcher. If you’re repairing cars for a living, you will want all of your tools beside you before you start. Arranging your workspace before starting your work will save you precious time later during the day.
  Have less physical things around you that might distract you: If I leave a book on my desk I will surely go through it at some moment.
  Leave your phone in the other room if you’re not able to control yourself: No matter how well prepared my mind is, it will still want to check my phone. So, leaving it somewhere else is probably the best solution.
  Say No to most of the things: As mentioned, your mind will constantly convince you that there is something else that needs to be doing: “check your phone”; “have a snack”; “go to the coffee shop around the corner”; “call your husband”. There is always something. Learn to give your monkey mind another job. Tell him, “Ok, we’ll check the phone after I write 500 words”, or “I’ll work 10 more minutes and I’ll take a break”.
